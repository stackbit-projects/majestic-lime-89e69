        description: "Hi I'm Mikayla -- a handcrafted jeweler based out of Idaho. I started a small jewelry stand in 2010 as a side hobby, which eventually grew into a life passion â™¥ I have been making jewelry and refining my technique ever since.\n\n\n\nI am excited to make my way online and share my art with more people. If you like my work you can find me on social media as well under @madexmikayla\n\n\n\nIf you have questions or want to discuss custom orders you can contact me at\_[**madebymikaylastore@gmail.com**](mailto:madebymikaylastore@gmail.com)\n"
